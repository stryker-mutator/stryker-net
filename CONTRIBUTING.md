# Contributing to Stryker.NET
This is the contribution guide for Stryker.NET. Great to have you here! Here are a few ways you can help make this project better.

## Creating issues
Do you have an idea for a feature or have you found a bug? Please create an issue so we can talk about it!
If you found a bug, please run ```dotnet stryker --log-level-file``` and add the content of the log file to the issue.

## Running Stryker.NET locally
While developing on Stryker.NET we advise to work in [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/)

### Steps to run Stryker on Stryker:
*	Clone the repository `https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker-net.git`
*	Open `Stryker.CLI.sln`
*	On `Stryker.CLI` open `properties > Debug`
*	Create a new Debug profile
*	Set `Launch` as `Project` 
*	Set `WorkingDirectory` as your local installation dir, pointing to a UnitTest project `example: (C:\Repos\stryker-net\src\Stryker.Core\Stryker.Core.UnitTest)`
*	Run the program with `Stryker.CLI` as the startup project with the newly created Debug profile

## Adding new features
New features are welcome! Either as requests or proposals.

1.	Please create an issue first, so we know what to expect from you.

## Community
