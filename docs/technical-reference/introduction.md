Welcome to the Stryker.NET technical references! In this wiki you will find background knowledge about Stryker.NET and some technical details.

### Why Stryker.NET
Before Stryker moved to .NET there already were some mutation testing tools available for mutation testing C# code. None seemed to be able to mutate .NET Core projects. With Stryker.NET we wanted to broaden the mutation test landscape. 

### Goals
Our long term goals are:
* Offer broad support for .NET projects
  * .NET Framework 4.6+ 
  * .NET Core 1.0+
  * .NET 5+
  * C#
  * F#
* Be a blazing fast mutation test framework
* Have the most detailed reporting experience for tracking down bugs

### Background
Stryker.NET is the result of an internship and became open-source in July 2018.
