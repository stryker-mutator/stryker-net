Stryker supports a variety of reporters. Enabled reporters will be activated during or after your Stryker run. 

The default reporters are [html](#html-reporter) and [progress](#progress-reporter)

# Html reporter
Our html reporter will output a html file that will visually display your project and all mutations. This is our recommended reporter for larger projects, since it displays large number of mutations in a clear way. 

```bash
dotnet stryker --reporter "html"
```

Example:

![html reporter](./images/html-report-net.png)

# Progress reporter
This reporter outputs the current status of the mutation testrun. It has a nice visual look so you can quickly see the progress. We recommend to use this reporter on large projects. It also shows an indication of the estimated time for Stryker.NET to complete.

```bash
dotnet stryker --reporter "progress"
```

Example:

![progress bar reporter](./images/progress-bar-net.png)

# Dashboard reporter
The dashboard reporter will upload your stryker result as json to the [stryker dashboard](https://dashboard.stryker-mutator.io/). To use this reporter some settings should be configured:

```bash
dotnet stryker --reporter "dashboard"
```

The following options are relevant when using the dashboard reporter:
- [Api key](./configuration.md#dashboard-api-key-string) - required
- [Project name](./configuration.md#project-infoname-string) - required (unless using SourceLink)
- [Project version](./configuration.md#project-infoversion-string) - required (unless using SourceLink)
- [Project module](./configuration.md#project-infomodule-string) - optional

## Use SourceLink for dashboard reporterâ€‹

Filling all settings to use the dashboard reporter can be a bit of a hassle. However, thanks to [SourceLink](https://github.com/dotnet/sourcelink#readme), the repository URL and the full version (including the git SHA1) of a project can be included in the produced assembly.

Stryker uses the information computed by SourceLink to automatically retrieve the project name (github.com/organization/project) and project version, both of which are requirements for the dashboard reporter.

Enable this by adding the following to your `.csproj` or `Directory.Build.props` to enable in all your projects:

``` xml
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="DotNet.ReproducibleBuilds" Version="0.1.66" PrivateAssets="All"/>
  </ItemGroup>
```

For more information on SourceLink and ReproducibleBuilds see SourceLink and Dotnet.ReproducibleBuilds

# Cleartext reporter
It displays all files right after the mutation testrun is done. Ideal for a quick run, as it leaves no file on your system.

```bash
dotnet stryker --reporter "cleartext"
```

Example:

![console reporter](./images/console-reporter-net.png)

# Cleartext tree reporter
It displays all mutations right after the mutation testrun is done. Ideal for a quick run, as it leaves no file on your system. It is recommended to turn this reporter off on big projects.

```bash
dotnet stryker --reporter "cleartexttree"
```

Example:

![Cleartext reporter](./images/console-reporter-tree.png)

# Dots reporter
A basic reporter to display the progress of the mutation testrun. It indicates in a very simple way how many mutants have been tested and their status. This is ideal to use on build servers, as it has little/no performance loss while still giving insight.

```bash
dotnet stryker --reporter "dots"
```

Example:

![Dots reporter](./images/console-dots-reporter-net.png)

Where `"."` means killed, `"S"` means survived and `"T"` means timed out.

# Json reporter
This reporter outputs a json file with all mutation testrun info of the last run. The json is also used for the HTML reporter, but using this reporter you could use the file for your own purposes.

```bash
dotnet stryker --reporter "json"
```

# Markdown summary reporter
This reporter outputs a Markdown formatted summary file called `mutation-report.md` (by default) in the `StrykerOutput/{date-time}/reports` directory.  

```bash
dotnet stryker --reporter "markdown"
```

Example:

# Mutation Testing Summary

| File                                                        | Score   | Killed | Survived | Timeout | No Coverage | Ignored | Compile Errors | Total Detected | Total Undetected | Total Mutants |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------ | -------- | ------- | ----------- | -------- | -------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| Utils\\Extensions.cs      | 76.74%  | 66     | 14       | 0       | 6           | 9        | 0              | 66             | 20               | 95            |
| Entities\\Entity1.cs     | N\/A    | 0      | 0        | 0       | 0           | 0        | 0              | 0              | 0                | 0             |
| Program.cs                        | 87.50%  | 7      | 0        | 0       | 1           | 0        | 0              | 7              | 1                | 8             |

## The final mutation score is 78.70%
