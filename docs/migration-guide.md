# Migration guide

This guide instructs how to update major versions of Stryker.NET.

## V2.x --> V3.x

### :pushpin: Baseline

The allowed format of the [azure-fileshare-sas](./configuration.md#azure-fileshare-sas-string) option has changed. SAS must contain `sv=` and `sig=` to be valid. SAS without sv= are no longer transformed to valid SAS. If you supply stryker with an azure fileshare sas that does not include `sv=` or `sig=` you will have to update your azure-fileshare-sas.

## V1.x --> V2.x

### ‚è≠ Updated runtime

The .NET runtime requirement for Stryker.NET has been updated from dotnet 5.0 to dotnet 6.0 LTS.

Please [download and install the dotnet 6 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0) and update your pipeline have the dotnet 6 runtime available.

_Note that you do not have to update your application to target dotnet 6. Dotnet 6 is only a runtime requirement for stryker to be able to run on your system._

## V0.x --> V1.x

### ‚è≠ Updated runtime

The .NET runtime requirement for Stryker.NET has been updated from 3.1 to 5.0.

Please [download and install the dotnet 5 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0) and update your pipeline have the dotnet 5 runtime available.

_Note that you do not have to update your application to use dotnet 5. Dotnet 5 is only a runtime requirement for stryker to be able to run on your system._

### ‚è≠ Options rework

Almost all options have been renamed or work different. A fundamental difference on the CLI is how multi value options are passed.

#### Multi value options

The old annotation for passing multi value options was confusing and not based on any standards. For example this is how multiple reporters were passed üëé

```shell
dotnet stryker --reporters "['html', 'progress']"
```

This now looks like üëç

```shell
dotnet stryker --reporter "html" --reporter "progress"
```

#### Options migration guide

A lot of options have been renamed. We have also decided that some options either do not belong on the commandline or don't belong in the configuration file. For example an API key should not be stored in the configuration file so that possibility has been removed.
