## Project Overview

Stryker.NET is a mutation testing framework for .NET projects. It allows you to test your tests by temporarily inserting bugs (mutations) in your source code to verify that tests catch them.

## Contributing Workflow

### Code Standards
- Follow the repository's `.editorconfig` and [Microsoft C# coding guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions)
- Create or edit unit tests or integration tests for all changes
- Update documentation when adding features

### Development Setup
1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker-net.git`
2. Open `Stryker.sln` in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE
3. The solution contains multiple projects under the `src/` directory

### Running Tests
- **Unit tests**: Run `dotnet test` in the `/src` directory
- **Integration tests**: These will be run automatically in the CI/CD pipeline during pull requests
- Always run unit tests before committing changes

### Testing Locally
To test Stryker.NET on a project:
1. In `Stryker.CLI`, open `properties > Debug`
2. Create a new Debug profile
3. Set `Launch` as `Project`
4. Set `WorkingDirectory` to a unit test project directory
5. You can use projects in `.\integrationtest\TargetProjects` for testing
6. Run with `Stryker.CLI` as the startup project

**Note**: Running Stryker on itself doesn't work as assemblies will be in use. To run Stryker on the stryker codebase, use the official nuget release via `dotnet tool install dotnet-stryker` and then `dotnet stryker`.

## Adding a New Mutator

See the full guide in [adding_a_mutator.md](../adding_a_mutator.md).

### Key Points for Mutators
1. **Purpose**: Generate mutations that look like possible human errors, not just any mutation
2. **Performance**: Keep mutators fast - they're called on every syntax element
3. **Buildable**: Generated mutations should compile in most situations
4. **Killable**: Avoid mutations that always raise exceptions or are semantically equivalent
5. **General**: Mutators should work for all projects, not be framework-specific

### Implementation Steps
1. Create a class inheriting from `MutatorBase<T>` and implementing `IMutator`
2. Specify the expected `SyntaxNode` class you can mutate (e.g., `StatementSyntax`)
3. Override the `MutationLevel` property (typically `Complete` or `Advanced`)
4. Override `ApplyMutation<T>` to generate mutations
5. Add an entry in the `Mutator` enum
6. Create an instance in the `CsharpMutantOrchestrator` constructor
7. Add comprehensive unit tests
8. Update [docs/mutations.md](../docs/mutations.md)

### Mutator Guidelines
- Use Roslyn APIs to work with syntax trees, not text transformations
- Each mutator is called on every syntax element recursively
- Return an empty list or `yield break` if no mutation can be generated
- Mutators must not throw exceptions
- Support various C# syntax versions (expression body vs block statement)
- Invest in unit tests early - look at existing mutator tests for examples

## Commit Message Format

Follow the [Conventional Commit guidelines](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/blob/main/instructions/conventional-commit.prompt.md):
- Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>\n\n[body]`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Scope: the file or group of files (not strict)
- Subject and body: use present tense (e.g., "change" not "changed", "add" not "added")
- Include motivation and contrasts with previous behavior in the body
