# Stryker.NET
*Professor X: For someone who hates mutants... you certainly keep some strange company.*
*William Stryker: Oh, they serve their purpose... as long as they can be controlled.*

## Introduction
Stryker offers mutation testing for your .NET Core and .NET Framework projects. It allows you to test your tests by temporarily inserting bugs in your source code

For an introduction to mutation testing and Stryker's features, see [stryker-mutator.io](https://stryker-mutator.io/). Looking for mutation testing in [JavaScript & Typescript](https://stryker-mutator.github.io/stryker) or [Scala](https://stryker-mutator.github.io/stryker4s)?

## Getting started

Stryker is installed using [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotnet-stryker/) as a dotnet core tool

<details>

### Install globally
`dotnet tool install -g dotnet-stryker`

### Install in project
Starting from dotnet core 3.0 dotnet tools can also be installed on a project level. This requires the following steps:

Create a file called dotnet-tools.json in your project folder

`dotnet new tool-manifest` 

Then install stryker without the -g flag by executing the following command in the project folder

`dotnet tool install dotnet-stryker`

Check the `dotnet-tools.json` file into source control

Now the rest of your team can install or update stryker with the following command:
`dotnet tool restore`

Now you can run stryker from your test project directory by executing:

`dotnet stryker`

### Updating stryker
Dotnet tools do not auto update so you are responsible for making sure you're up-to-date. To help with this stryker will notify you when a new version is available

To update stryker as a global tool run `dotnet tool update --global dotnet-stryker`

To update stryker as a project tool run `dotnet tool update --local dotnet-stryker` or change the version in the `dotnet-tools.json` file. Then check in the updated `dotnet-tools.json` file.
